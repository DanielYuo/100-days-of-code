# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I currently learning the basic of python through Automate the Boring Stuff book and Python Crash Course book, and at the chapter about dictionaries. It's been around a week or two after I first started to learn how to code. 

**Thoughts:** So far I still can understand what those books are teaching me. Tho, some of the assignments were quite challenging.
